TrainSessions

<p>My daily commute includes roughly 2x45 minutes of a train trip. I find Sydney trains being surprisingly good creative space, somehow train movement ignites thoughts movement. Despite people around this time feels like a special personal time for me that I even tagged it internally as a “Train Sessions”. A substantial share of my GitHub activity could be attributed to Train Sessions.</p>
