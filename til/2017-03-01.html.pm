◊main{ Yesterday my credentials for
◊link["https://app.lightnote.co/"]{LightNote} has been arrived, and I started to
follow the course. But with a twist: I decided to make exercises in Extempore
and ◊link["https://github.com/ul/lightnote"]{publish them on GitHub.} First
chapter "Sound" is done! That's my ◊code{TIL.}

Enjoy and send me patches if you are into this thing too =)
