    <h1>Sound Garden Manifesto <a class="goto-index supra" href=
    "/">⤴</a></h1>
    <p>Reflections on guiding principles of <a href=
    "https://github.com/ul/livecore">LiveCore</a> (née Sound
    Garden)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Sound Garden never meant to be a product, a thing by
        itself. It's a by-product of the creative journey.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Creativity blossoms without limit when put in
        consciously defined constraints. Self-posed restrictions
        are what helps to maintain focus and embody art
        artifacts.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Sound Garden's leitmotif constraint is doing everything
        live and in real-time. If your sound graph can’t be
        computed sample by sample for each channel in real-time,
        then drop it and find a new one. This does not prevent
        performance optimizations of the platform, rather contrary
        it encourages them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Don't be afraid to be naive, you are exploring a
        mysterious landscape.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>True understanding comes as the ability to re-create
        subject from scratch. With own style.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Style <em>is</em> constraints working for you.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>This document is just a reflection of Sound Garden
        spirit and practices, no way it's primary to them. The
        manifesto is living and is to be updated whenever it needs
        to be.</p>
