◊topic{Welcome}

◊main{

Welcome, stranger. I'm Ruslan Prokopchuk, and it's my corner of the Web.

This place is going to be a log of random thoughts, which I'm gathering and decorating these days during coffee breaks. Stay tuned and check out ◊link["/archive.html"]{Archive}!

At the daytime I do software engineering, mostly front-end. See my ◊link[cv-url]{CV} or ◊link[linked-url]{LinkedIn profile} for details. I admire functional programming, Clojure & ClojureScript, and I'm learning OCaml for a greater good. I do a little bit of open-source, don't miss my ◊link[github-url]{GitHub} page for some fun stuff.

At the night I transform to a flute and live coding junkie. Nothing to share at the moment, but if you are interested in learning and jammming together, don't hesitate to contact me!

Get in touch by email ◊link[(string-append "mailto:" email) email] or twitter ◊link[twitter-url twitter-name].
