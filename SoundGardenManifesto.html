<div>Reflections on guiding principles of <a href="https://github.com/ul/sound-garden">Sound Garden</a></div><ul><li>Sound Garden never meant to be a product, a thing by itself. It's a by-product of the creative journey.</li><li>Creativity blossoms without limit when put in consciously defined constraints. Self-posed restrictions are what helps to maintain focus and embody art artifacts.</li><li>Sound Garden's leitmotif constraint is doing everything live and in real-time. If your sound graph canâ€™t be computed sample by sample for each channel in real-time, then drop it and find a new one. This does not prevent performance optimizations of the platform, rather contrary it encourages them.</li><li>Don't be afraid to be naive, you are exploring a mysterious landscape.</li><li>True understanding comes as the ability to re-create subject from scratch. With own style.</li><li>Style <em>is</em> constraints working for you.</li><li>This document is just a reflection of Sound Garden spirit and practices, no way it's primary to them. The manifesto is living and is to be updated whenever it needs to be.</li></ul>
